This is an example of what you can do with Covalent API, in this repo I have created a browser extension that keep track of the price of your favourite cryptocurrencies making use of the Covalent API.

# Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository in your PC;
2. Change if you want/need the index html with your title and image (optional);
3. Change the '...' spaces in the script.js file, you have to set your Covalent API, set the correct endpoint, choose the crypto ticker you want to add;
4. If you have trouble with this points I made a video tutorial (italian speaking):  or you can check the Covalent Docs: https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/0/USD/1;
5. Add the extension in your browser, just go in extension settings, enable "developer mode" and upload the folder that contains all of your files using the "unpacked extension" button;

This is it!
